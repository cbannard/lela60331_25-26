        "In our model building so far we have been generating our predicted values by taking the dot product of vectors of weights and vectors of features (and adding the bias). However we want to move on to using more features than just 2. When we have lots of features, it is more efficient to handle the sets of j features for k items as a k x j matrix rather than as j vectors of length k. To combine our weights and our features we then need to take the dot product of each row of our feature matrix with our vector of weights. As you saw in this week's lecture we can take the dot product between a matrix with j columns and a row vector of length j. This can be done in numpy as follows:"
